# Hey there! I'm Mikaela :sparkles:

I'm a Frontend Development student at Medieinstitutet, diving deep into the world of web development with an open mind.

## :art: About me:
ðŸ“š Currently studying Frontend Development </br> ðŸŽ¨ Design, color, and form are my happy place</br> ðŸŽ“ Graduating in 2026 (mark your calendars, Iâ€™ll be ready to take on the world by then!) 

## :globe_with_meridians: My Journey:
When blogging became all the rage in my teenage years, I found myself fascinated by the ability to tweak HTML and CSS to personalize my blog. I started creating new blogs almost every month, but eventually realized that I was doing it purely for the joy of designing and redesigning. Thatâ€™s also when I discovered my love for Photoshop.

Life got in the way as I grew older, but when it came time to choose a career path, I knew exactly where my heart was â€“ back to design, development, and everything in between. Now, Iâ€™m on a mission to bring creative ideas to life on the web!

Feel free to check out my repos and join me on my journey as I work towards becoming a front-end pro. ðŸš€
